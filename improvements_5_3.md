Great! With such a tight timeline for implementing these improvements, it's essential to prioritize effectively and perhaps simplify some steps if needed. Here's a streamlined approach for each objective, focusing on making meaningful progress in a short period:

### Simplified Action Plan for Immediate Execution

#### 1. **Performance Optimization**
- **Quick Profiling**: Use lightweight profiling (e.g., Pythonâ€™s `timeit` for quick checks) to identify slow functions.
- **Immediate Fixes**: Apply quick optimizations such as:
  - Speedup the identify_leaf_nodes()
  - Speedup sample_leaf_nodes()
  - Reducing function calls.
  - Simplifying data structures.
  - If parallel processing is feasible, apply it to the most time-consuming parts.

#### 2. **Tree Depth Management**
- **Configurable Parameter**: Quickly add a maximum depth parameter to your tree-building logic.
- **Depth Encouragement**: Modify your node selection strategy to prefer nodes that contribute to depth, perhaps by adjusting their selection probability based on current depth.

#### 3. **Special Characters Elimination**
- **Regex Application**: Implement a simple regex substitution in your text processing pipeline to strip out special characters or replace them immediately after generation.

### Implementation Tips
- **Work in Branches**: If you're using version control, make these changes in separate branches to ensure that you can revert or adjust without affecting the mainline.
- **Automated Testing**: If possible, set up basic automated tests to catch major issues quickly.
- **Incremental Changes**: Apply changes incrementally and test frequently to ensure that each change produces the desired effect without unintended consequences.

### Review and Adjustment
- At the end of these two days, take a brief period to review the changes and their impacts. This can be informal, focusing on whether the changes meet your immediate needs.
