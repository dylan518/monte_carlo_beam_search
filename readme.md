Project Title: Exploring Sequence Generation with Monte Carlo Beam Search on a Phi-1.5 Model
Project Description
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to explore an advanced sequence generation method that combines Monte Carlo simulation with beam search evaluation techniques. This hybrid approach aims to leverage the stochastic nature of Monte Carlo methods for broad exploration and the structured evaluation strength of beam search for selecting highly probable sequences. This project will utilize a Phi-1.5 model for probability distribution across the vocabulary during sequence generation.
Methodology:
Model Initialization: Utilize a Phi-1.5 language model to generate the initial probabilities for each token in the vocabulary at every step of sequence generation. This model will provide a sophisticated understanding of token probabilities, which are essential for both the Monte Carlo simulation and the beam evaluation phases.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Begin the sequence generation process by using Monte Carlo methods to sample sequences broadly. This step focuses on generating a diverse set of possible sequences without the initial constraint of selecting only the highest probability paths.
Sequence Scoring: After each sequence generation step, apply the beam search scoring formula (sum of log probabilities) to each sequence. This scoring mechanism evaluates the sequences based on their likelihood, as determined by the cumulative log probabilities of their constituent tokens.
Graph Construction and Iterative Expansion: Construct a graph that represents the sequences as nodes, with edges representing the probabilistic transitions between tokens. This graph will be expanded iteratively using further Monte Carlo searches, exploring new nodes (sequences) that branch from existing ones based on their calculated beam probabilities.
Optimization and Selection: Throughout the generation process, continuously select and refine sequences based on their beam scores. Focus on expanding parts of the graph where higher-scoring sequences are found, iteratively refining the search towards the most likely and coherent outputs.
Expected Outcomes:
A robust set of diverse sequences that are evaluated based on both their innovative qualities (via Monte Carlo exploration) and their adherence to likely and coherent structure (via beam search scoring).
Insights into the balance between exploration and exploitation in sequence generation, providing a deeper understanding of how different search strategies can be combined effectively.
Applications:
This method could be particularly beneficial for creative text generation tasks, such as storytelling, content creation in diverse styles, or any scenario requiring high-quality, varied textual outputs. It may also provide a novel approach to other sequence generation tasks in natural language processing, including machine translation and automated summarization, where diversity and quality are crucial.
